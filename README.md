# Rust Part 1

To run the example scripts, do, for example, `python demo_rs references_01.rs` (or change the run specification line to use your own Python). This Python script tries to compile the file with `rustc` (which you must have installed). If successful the script will print "L&L: Build successful" and will then run the resulting executable, and finally will delete the executable.
